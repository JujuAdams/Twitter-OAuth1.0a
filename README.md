### @jujuadams

Library to interface with Twitter's web API. Allows for both "PIN" and "3-leg" authorisation flows. Goes beyond read-only public calls and allows for full interaction with a user's account and tweets. Use wisely!

**N.B. You will need to provide your own Twitter OAuth credentials.**
